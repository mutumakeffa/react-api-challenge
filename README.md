This is the react app challenge, required to fetch login data and task data from API end points <br>


To run the app during development phase:
1. run use the following command:
### `npm start`

To run during production
### `npm run build`

- This builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
